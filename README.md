# About

As one of the most recognizable and influential video game brands in the world, it’s no wonder why there are hundreds of millions of Tetris products being played, worn, and enjoyed by fans in their everyday lives. For over thirty-five years, the game and brand have truly transcended the barriers of culture and language, resulting in a fun and exciting playing experience for everyone, everywhere!

# How to play

The Tetris® game requires players to strategically rotate, move, and drop a procession of Tetriminos that fall into the rectangular Matrix at increasing speeds. Players attempt to clear as many lines as possible by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty space, but if the Tetriminos surpass the Skyline the game is over! It might sound simple, but strategy and speed can go a long way! Are YOU up for the challenge?

# Tetris Effect

The Tetris® Effect is a catchy term that players use to describe the way they are inspired by the game and see Tetriminos in everyday situations. Because Tetris, like the real world, challenges players to make order out of chaos using a specific organization system, the game components translate easily into lifestyle interpretations. Whether you're packing the trunk of your car, loading a dishwasher, or organizing your shelves, you're likely thinking about how each object will fit together strategically with minimal empty space. This is the Tetris Effect!
